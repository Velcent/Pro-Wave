//! Pattern regions and Drummer regions (Logic Pro: Step Sequencer pattern regions and Drummer

//! for any MIDI region (the engine plays them like the rest), and made again whenever the
//! settings or the length of the region change.
//!
//! - A **pattern** is a grid of steps, one row to a pitch, that loops over the region.
//! - A **drummer** plays a drum kit in a style, more or less busy and loud, and fills the end
//!   of every fourth bar now and then. The same settings always give the same notes.
